For a long time I did not care about emoji. But when I was reading Zach Holman's
post about abusing Mac OS X with emoji, I realized, there is something new and
innovative with emoji. I started to use them more and more and today I even put
them into commit messages, tweets and emails.

Technology's influence on writing
---------------------------------

It is no surprise, that technology has changed writing all the time in history.
Writing on clay tablets required a proper writing system like cuneiform script.
Later when people started writing on paper by hand, cursive was invented and
allowed a better and obviously faster writing.

Our modern writing systems with block letters and different glyphs in different
fonts comes from printing. It allowed people to produce multiple copies of a
text and reach more readers. This technical innovation simply changed the
standard way of writing from cursive to block letters and printed text.

Digital technology's influence
------------------------------

For some time computers where used to write texts for printing them on paper and
even today some people still print there emails. But with the ongoing success of
digital technology and the world wide web, this has changed. Today I read books
on my Kindle and some of them are never printed on any paper. I communicate with
my friends and my family via Whatsapp and all these message are kept digital.

An impact of digitalization of writing on our writing system is quite normal as
it has always been with technical innovations. Communicating an emotion or an
object like a car or a glass of beer with a single colored picture has become
very popular with Skype, Twitter or Whatsapp. I am flying from Berlin Schönefeld
to Moscow Sheremetyevo is much more to type on a smartphone than just SXF ✈️
SVO.

The innovation of Unicode
-------------------------

The current version 7.0 of the Unicode standard supports 113,021 characters from
123 scripts. Unicode is the number one reason, why people around the world from
different nations and different cultures can use smartphones, browse the world
wide web or blog about their passions. Unicode has democratized technology more
than any other digital innovation.

Until October 2010 the focus of the Unicode Consortium was to bring historical
writing systems on digital systems. With version 6.0 this has changed, since the
standard got a first set of 722 emoji characters. An additional set of 250 emoji
characters was added with version 7.0.

These characters are normal Unicode characters and can be used as any other
character in any text. If you send a Whatsapp message with a kissing smiley (😘)
to your sweetheart today, it will be send as Unicode character U+1F618.

How far is the industry
-----------------------

There are two technical ways of supporting Emoji in a system. The simple one is
to add a font with glyphs for the characters. This will result in monochrome
icons and works without any problems. Microsoft has done this by extending its
Segoe UI font, which was introduced as the system font in Windows 7, with emoji
characters. Google added its own font for emoji characters in Android 4.1 and
Ubuntu users can install the package ttf-ancient-fonts to get emoji characters.

While this approach works pretty well, the monochrome emoji symbols are not very
beautiful and expressive. The alternative is to extend fonts with color. Apple
was one of the first supporters of emoji at all by adding their Apple Color
Emoji font to Mac OS X and iOS. Microsoft has also added a color emoji font to
Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, but it is only used by its modern DirectWrite
API. Google replaced its monochrome emoji font with a colored version in Android
4.4.

Today all mayor systems also provide a way of emoji character input. You can
enter emoji characters almost everywhere on iOS, Android (as of 4.4) and Windows
Phone via an emoji keyboard, but also on Mac OS X and Windows 8 via an on screen
keyboard.

The best browsers are currently Safari and Firefox. Both show native color emoji
in web pages on Mac and Windows. Internet Explorer started to use monochrome
emojis by default with version 10. But there is still one big problem for safely
using emoji on web pages. Google Chrome does not render emoji characters in web
pages on Mac and Windows. Only on Android it is able to show the new color emoji
from Android 4.4.

Conclusion
----------

Emoji is the next evolution in human writing 👍!
IT people should care about it.
